## Manufacturing, Assembly, Storage, Combined.

Why isn't there a service where I can describe my manufacturing and assembly steps, pay upfront, and have my product manufactured, assembled, and stored for me?  
Why isn't there a marketplace for manufacturing processes, with smart logistics where I can make my own assembly line virtually?  

I'm picturing a website where you create your assembly line in steps:  

    * I need something 3D printed, here's the CAD.
    * I need such and such metal pieces, here's the CAD.
    * I need this PCB, here's the CAD.
    * such and such external parts are needed: <list of external parts>
    * I need all of this assembled and tested, here's how: <insert pdf or whatever (assembly as code?)>
    * I need to flash the firmware, here's the binary.
    * Then ship it to this address: insert warehouse address here. (or better yet, keep this in a warehouse and make shipments as batches are being sold)

Then you may get some options:  
 
    * 3D print at this location for this amount of $, here's the ETA.
    * Metal at this location for this amount of $, here's the ETA.
    * Such and such can make this PCB, here's the cost and total time
    * Such and such can assemble this, here's the cost and total time
    * etc

Bonus points: Some processes run in parallel, meaning some things can be done cheaper and take longer without extending ETA.

When you have designed your assembly line, you select the number of units, and pay upfront. ETA X weeks. Start selling.  
Need a new batch? Place another order in 10 seconds. Fuck it, just automate a new order at 10% stock.

It enables something similar to a fabless chip company for product design; an end-to-end merchandise company with no hardware or assembly-line.  

Am I dreaming?  
Would anyone like to invest?
